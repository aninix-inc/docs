title: Events Specification

import { Mermaid } from '../../../components/mermaid'

Every event in the Aninix system is coupled to a specific change in any resource. For example, when a new `RenderJob` is created, it triggers sending an event to the url specified in the webhook.

:::note
Every event includes 2 object states: `current` and `previous`. Aninix sends the complete object for `current`. And for `previuos`, only the fields that have changed are included. This allows the client to more accurately decide what to do based on the data received.
:::

For example, the status of `RenderJob` has changed from `processing` to `completed`, then the event of the following format will be sent:

```json {9-10} {19-20}
{
  "id": "7af973c4-4ea2-41c0-bc17-dd6dccab99d3",
  "entity": "event",
  "apiVersion": "1",
  "livemode": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-02-18T18:30:00.000Z",
  "type": "renderJob.completed",
  "previous": {
    "status": "processing",
    "updatedAt": "2024-02-18T18:30:01.000Z"
  },
  "current": {
    "id": "8b5d1120-0419-41cd-9c09-f56b29144a88",
    "hash": "4a5d0436cbad9c29fbf09f036bc9bf7ff91ad463d8b932fb97a1f8d301a37ef2",
    "name": "Sample project #1 ðŸš€",
    "storyboard": { ... },
    "createdAt": "2024-02-18T18:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-02-18T18:35:00.000Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "fileUrl": "https://static.aninix.com/8b5d1120-0419-41cd-9c09-f56b29144a88.mp4",
    "metadata": { ... }
  }
}
```

The same pattern is applied in the [webhooks](/render-api/webhooks-spec).

## Realtime events on the frontend

In order to get real-time information we use SSE (server-sent events) channels. They allow to send information about changes in resources in one-way.

:::note
Each resource has its own event channel, you can find it at this address: `/{resourceName}/{resourceId}/events`.
:::

When you first subscribe to the channel, an `InitiatedEvent` is sent immediately, which contains information about the current state of the resource.

<Mermaid
  graph={`
sequenceDiagram
    Client-->>Aninix API: SSE request
    Aninix API-->>Client: Subscription confirmation
    Aninix API->>Client: InitiatedEvent sent
    Aninix API->>Client: ResourceUpdate event sent
`}
  client:idle
/>

The simplest example of use case:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SSE Client Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>SSE Client Example</h1>

    <script>
      const token = '{YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}'
      const resourceName = 'render-jobs'
      const resourceId = 'some-id'
      const eventSource = new EventSource(
        `https://apipi.aninix.com/${resourceName}/${resourceId}/events?token=${token}`
      )

      eventSource.addEventListener('open', () => {
        console.log('SSE connection established')
      })

      eventSource.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
        const eventData = JSON.parse(event.data)
        console.log('Received SSE event:', eventData)
        // Handle the received event data
      })

      eventSource.addEventListener('error', (error) => {
        console.error('SSE error:', error)
        // Handle SSE error
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
