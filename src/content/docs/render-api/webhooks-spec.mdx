title: Webhooks Specification
---

Aninix sends a POST request to the specified URL with JSON in the request body. It will wait 60 seconds for an success response with a status of 200+. Otherwise, it will marked as failed by timeout.

If the webhook request fails, Aninix will attempt to resend this webhook up to 5 times with a backoff strategy: 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes.

After all 5 attempts have failed, the webhook for certain events will no longer be triggered.

> All necessary security tokens will be defined and implemented soon (TBD). Also we would defined the endpoint and docs for how to get updated job if necessary (TBD).

## Webhook handler example written in typescript using nestjs framework

> It saves file to the local folder

```ts
import { Body, Controller, Post } from '@nestjs/common'
import * as fs from 'fs'
import { request } from 'http'

@Controller('webhooks/aninix')
class AninixWebhookController {
  @Post()
  async handle(@Body() event: WebhookEvent): Promise<void> {
    if (event.type === 'renderJob.completed') {
      const { fileUrl } = event.current
      const filePath = `some-local-path/${event.current.id}.mp4`
      const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream(filePath)

      return new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
        request(fileUrl).pipe(fileStream).on('error', reject)
        fileStream.on('error', reject)
        fileStream.on('finish', resolve)
      })
    }
  }
}
```
